# When to Mock

Mock at **system boundaries** only:

- External APIs (payment, email, etc.)
- Time/randomness
- Databases/filesystem (only when no test stand-in exists)

Don't mock:

- Your own classes/modules
- Internal collaborators
- Anything you control

## Designing for Mockability

At system boundaries, design interfaces that are easy to mock:

**1. Use dependency injection** (see [interface-design.md](interface-design.md) principle 1)

Pass external dependencies in rather than creating them internally.

**2. Prefer SDK-style interfaces over generic fetchers**

Create specific functions for each external operation instead of one generic function with conditional logic:

```typescript
// GOOD: Each function is independently mockable
const api = {
  getUser: (id) => fetch(`/users/${id}`),
  getOrders: (userId) => fetch(`/users/${userId}/orders`),
  createOrder: (data) => fetch('/orders', { method: 'POST', body: data }),
};

// BAD: Mocking requires conditional logic inside the mock
const api = {
  fetch: (endpoint, options) => fetch(endpoint, options),
};
```

SDK approach benefits: each mock returns one shape, no conditional logic in test setup, type safety per endpoint.
